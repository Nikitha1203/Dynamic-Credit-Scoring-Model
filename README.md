# Dynamic Credit Scoring Model

## Project Overview

The Dynamic Credit Scoring Model is a comprehensive machine learning project designed to develop an adaptive credit scoring model. This model adjusts in real-time based on customer behavior and economic indicators, leveraging non-traditional features such as online behavior, social media presence, and transactional data.

## Objective

The primary objective is to revolutionize credit risk assessment by:
- Improving precision in evaluating credit risk.
- Enabling proactive risk management strategies.
- Facilitating timely adjustments to lending strategies based on dynamic factors.

## Features

This project encompasses a range of features, including:
- Thorough data cleaning and exploration.
- Advanced feature engineering techniques.
- Development of a robust machine learning model.
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.
- In-depth model evaluation and interpretation.
- Data visualization to enhance understanding.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration:** Conducted a detailed exploration of the dataset, gaining insights into its structure and distribution.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Engineered a binary target variable, 'CreditScore,' based on the 'TransactionAmount' column, incorporating industry best practices.

3. **Data Splitting:** Applied effective data splitting techniques to create distinct training and testing sets for model development.

4. **Categorical Column Handling:** Utilized one-hot encoding to effectively handle categorical columns like 'Gender,' ensuring model compatibility.

5. **Model Development:** Implemented an advanced XGBoost classifier, leveraging hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Rigorously evaluated the final model's accuracy, confusion matrix, and generated a comprehensive classification report.

7. **Visualization:** Developed insightful visualizations, including feature importances, to provide a transparent interpretation of the model's decision-making process.
